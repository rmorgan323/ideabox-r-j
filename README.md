## IdeaBox

IdeaBox is a project created for Turing School of Software & Design by students Rob Morgan and Julie Hawkins over a period of one week.

It's built in jQuery.  IdeaBox allows a user to save ideas, rate by quality, filter by content or quality, and save to local storage.  It was our intial experience with jQuery only a few weeks after beginning school.  The styling is our own and is mobile-ready.
